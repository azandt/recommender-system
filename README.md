# recommender-system
This is a simple recommender system I made for a school project.
It selects 10 random movies from a database and prompts the user to give each of them a rating between 1 and 5.
The results will then be compared to the data in the database and will return a movie which (hopefully) aligns with the preferences of the user.

The TextAppender folder is a C# program that I used to append multiple text files in which all the data was spread out, into one large file. There is however a bug which causes it to duplicate the last line of each text file.
